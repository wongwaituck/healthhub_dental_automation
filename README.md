# HealthHub Dental Automation Example

Polyclinics have a booking system. Having not visited a doctor in some time, my feathers were rustled when I realized you HAD to go through this booking system and couldn't walk in anymore. 

I went online and found the experience a bit annoying. I got distracted and wanted to book a dental appointment and realized you had to click through each date, so I automated some parts of it.

## How to use

- Install selenium and chromedriver (somewhere in `$PATH`, presumably), install the python dependencies in `requirements.txt`

- Modify the list of URLs visited according to the UI flow for that particular medical service.

- Create a `.env` file with your actual user hash (see the URL when you click on your profile)

- Run the script, login via Singpass

- ???

- Profit!

## Other stuff

Use script at your own risk.
